# CodeClan Data Cleaning Project

This was the first large individual project I completed while taking the CodeClan Data Analysis Course. We were given four sets of data and prompts for summary information to gather from those sets of data. Extensive cleaning had to be done in order to answer the prompt questions for each file. The easiest way to view the files is from within RStudio.
